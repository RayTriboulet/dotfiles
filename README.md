# dotfiles

Firstly, learning proper Markdown is still on my to-do list, so I apologize for the lack of aesthetics on this README file.

  These are my dotfiles. If you wish to clone one or all of them, go for it. I would make sure you know what these do before implementing them. I currently run a dual Windows 10 / Ubuntu Mate boot system on a mid-size SSD. These files are really just for Unix-based systems. They may require some modification if you attempt to use them on Windows OS, though it is possible.

  ## Included here are the following:
  
  ### bashrc - 

  ### oh-my-zsh.sh - 

  ### tmux.conf - 

  ### vimrc - 

  ### zshrc -
